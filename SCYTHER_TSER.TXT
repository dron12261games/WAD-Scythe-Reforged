Description             : Scythe remake teaser. More specifically in this wad
                          - MAP20 remake. The project was born after the
                          closure of Scythe Re-Sharpened. 
                          
                          DO NOT USE GZDOOM WITH HARDWARE RENDERER OR OTHER 
                          GRAPHICS MODS! THEY DISTORT THE PICTURE VERY BADLY, 
                          OFTEN COMPLETELY DESTROYING THE ENTIRE VISUAL OF 
                          THE MAP AND WORK WITH LIGHTING! THIS MAP IS 
                          INTENDED ONLY FOR DOOM SOURCE-PORTS WITH CORRECT 
                          SOFTWARE RENDERER, SUCH AS DSDA, WOOF!, NUGGET DOOM, 
                          DOOM RETRO, ETERNITY ENGINE, ETC.

                          My goal is not just to improve the existing maps in
                          the scythe. My goal is to create new levels from
                          scratch, inspired by the original maps, keeping
                          recognizability of setting, visuals, frame palette,
                          special memorable moments, gameplay.

                          Update v2 (possibly final):
                          - fixed problem with progression after a boss fight
                          - added more ammo in the soul sphere secret
                          - minor fixes
